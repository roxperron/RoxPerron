#### I've been working as a QA Analyst since 2020, since then my passion for IT has only increased. In the fall of 2021, I started a continuing education program in front-end development that I will finish in June 2023 with an internship.  I love creating interfaces for websites and web applications. Take a look at my first projects in my pins!
